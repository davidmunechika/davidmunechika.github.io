I was a software development engineering (SDE) intern contributing to the backend development and scaling of AWS EC2 and VPC technologies. During my summer internship, I built packages using native AWS services such as Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Elastic Container Service (ECS), Fargate, Cloudwatch, Cloudformation, and Cloud Development Kit (CDK). Individually, I developed a backend service hosted by Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) technologies for monitoring and predicting scaling cliffs for internal AWS networking services. I especially utilized multithreading and distributed computing techniques to generate CloudWatch statistical dashboards with 1-minute metric granularity for 93 databases containing over 75 million records in total.
