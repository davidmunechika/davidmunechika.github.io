I contributed to both the distributed microservice backend and enterprise frontend architecture, completing agile software development to handle shipper/warehouse inventory management, order orchestration logic, facility activity services, and security compliance. Furthermore, during this internship I assisted a team of engineers in spearheading the load testing effort prior to a major software release, optimizing the performance of services to handle over 1.7 million order creations per day.
