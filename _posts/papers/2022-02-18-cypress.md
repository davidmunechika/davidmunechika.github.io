Cypress is the world's best automated test runner, with over 17 million downloads and users in over 90 countries. I worked across the stack to implement new features and fix bugs in the Cypress test runner, closely collaborated with product and design teams on product specifications, and contributed to the development, refinement, and hardening of the major Cypress v10 unification release. I also served as the support rotation engineer responsible for triaging new issues, fixing regressions, surfacing high-priority bugs, and engaging with the open-source community. Lastly, I individually created a repository of web hooks for automating ClickUp actions to streamline product management processes; integrated CI/CD with Vercel and Github Actions, code coverage with Codecov, and distributed tracing with Honeycomb.
